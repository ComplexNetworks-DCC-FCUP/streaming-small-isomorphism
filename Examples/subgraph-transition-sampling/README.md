# Case Study: Sampling of subgraph transitions

This example is meant to serve as a use case of the streaming small
graph canonisation method. It is described in detail in Appendix B of
the original paper.

## Brief description

A sample of subgraph transitions in a temporal network is
performed. For a given graph, this means calculating an estimation of
a Markov chain of graphs that represent temporal transitions of the
isomorphism class of the subgraphs of the given graph. More
information is available on the original paper.
